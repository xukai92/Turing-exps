# Scripts for make short introductory video for Turing

## Plan

1. Explain code in HMM.jl
2. Run inference and show result
  - The result of HMM.jl seems to be wrong
3. Explain changes in BayesHMM.jl
4. Run inference and show result
5. ~ 8. Do the same thing for LDA and MoC.
  - Maybe we need another dataset as the toy one we used doesn't even have real word representations?
